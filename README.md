# ProteinIdentificationNanoporeSequencingData

In this study, we have developed a computational pipeline for performing single molecule protein identification (SMPI). <br/>
The algorithm utilizes the electrical signal generated by a denatured and linearly charged protein passing through a nanopore and reports the theoretical nanospectrum.


# Dataset
You can download the data from https://indiana-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/abbash_iu_edu/EsGVl2AWNaxOlF4caf6SBq0BUALPevc6RM2ecC-mfLzHDA?e=OlACxB
Please copy the data files in the data folder.

## Train the model
You can train the model using the three different strategies. Please run the corresponding script to train that model.
Train the best model using ```python train_best_model.py```. It will save the best model in the project directory.

## Protein Identification
This module uses the trained model and the protein DB to identify the protein
```python identify_protein.py model DB```
